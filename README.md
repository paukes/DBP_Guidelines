# Disinfection By Product - [Guideline Conversion App](https://paukes.shinyapps.io/dbp_guidelines/)

A simple application to convert disinfection by product (DBP) guideline
concentrations (in ug/L) to molar (umol/L and umolC/L) and carbon-based
molecular weight (ug C/L). This app includes a range of values based on
the varying molecular weights of DBP species, as well as allows you to
select which species form your ‘guideline’.
